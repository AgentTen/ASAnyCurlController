## Purpose
ASCurlTransitionController gives you the ability to use Curl animation from any corner and in any direction.

iOS SDK allows only 2 types of curl animations, UIViewAnimationOptionTransitionCurlUp and UIViewAnimationOptionTransitionCurlDown. It gives no choice, a curl up transition curls a view up from the bottom, while a curl down transition curls a view down from the top.

With ASCurlTransitionController you are free to choose whether your up or down curl transition comes from the **top**, **bottom**, **left** and **right** and whether it is **horizontal** or **vertical**.

## Supported iOS
iOS 5 and above.

## ARC Compatibility
ASCurlTransitionController requires ARC. If you wish to use ASCurlTransitionController in a non-ARC project, just add the -fobjc-arc compiler flag to the "ASCurlTransitionController.m" file.

## Use it
Add `pod 'ASCurlTransitionController'` to your Podfile or copy 'ASCurlTransitionController.h' and 'ASCurlTransitionController.m' in your project.

ASCurlTransitionController is a UIViewController that will animate the transition between to view controllers, its current content controller and a new one.

You first set its initial content controller using its property `contentController`. Then you call `[ASCurlTransitionController animateTransitionDownWithController:duration:options:completion]` or `[ASCurlTransitionController animateTransitionUpWithController:duration:options:completion]` whether you want the new view to be revealed as if it were coming from above or below the current view.

`options` parameter lets you specify the corner (`ASCurlTransitionOptionTopLeft`, `ASCurlTransitionOptionTopRight`, `ASCurlTransitionOptionBottomLeft`, `ASCurlTransitionBottomRight`) and direction (`ASCurlTransitionOptionHorizontal` or `ASCurlTransitionOptionVertical`).

In a Curl Down transition, the specified corner is where the animation starts, while in a Curl Up transition it is where the animation ends. 


## Technical explanation
The system uses a standard curl animation (launched by [UIView transitionWithView]) on which a specific transform is applied. This transform is composed of some PI/2 rotation and some horizontal and/or vertical mirroring (-1 scaling in fact) depending on the wanted corner and direction. This transform is set on a specific view which is created only for this purpose, which we call the 'transformedView'. But this is not enough, as the final animated view would otherwise be also transformed. The trick is to cancel this transform by applying its opposite transform. And as we don't want to alter the initial view (because it may have its own transform), we use a specific view, called 'contentView'.

So, in order to achieve the effect, ASCurlTransitionController uses this stack of views: the standard controller's view, the 'transformedView', the 'contentView', and finally the view that is going to be visually animated (your view).
The 'transformView' bears a transform that configures the corner and direction of the curl, while the 'contentView' bears a transform that cancel the above transform. Finally the transition is launched on the 'contentView', et voilÃ !

In other words, here is the view hierarchy :

	ASCurlTransitionController's View
		--> transformedView   <-- specific transform
			--> contentView   <-- opposite transform
				--> final view
